# JavaScript quick reference

This is a JavaScript language quick reference, focusing on moderate and advanced topics used in coding interviews or coding competitions.

This reference is focused on the ECMAScript ES6/ES2015 version of the language, which introduces some important changes, all described in the _ES6 improvement_ section.

## Running the code

The code is based on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) so can run as a standalone application, and can be edited used the we will use the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editor.

The code can also be tested using the _console_ available on the [Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/open/).

## Good to know

The environment where JavaScript born is the _Browser_. For this reason, occasionally also other technologies will be used and explained, like:

- The _Document Object Model (DOM)_: a structured representation of a client UI defined using the _HTML_ language.
- The _HTML language_: used for describing the structure of the client UI.
- The _CSS language_: used for defining attributes of the elements of the _HTML_ UI.
- The _Events_: generated by the _Browser_, will cause code execution based on _user interaction_, _networks events_ or _timers_.
- The _React_ library/framework.

## 1. What makes JavaScript different from other languages

Although part of the language syntax is very similar to other ones, some _JavaScript_ concepts differ fundamentally, and need a particular care:

- ***Scopes***: only recently (ES6) _JavaScript_ acquire the ability to limit the scope of a variable to the block level. Before of that, only global variables were allowed.
- ***Functions are first-class objects***: functions can be treated as any other _JavaScript_ object. They can referenced by variables, returned as values in a function return, referenced as variables, and created through literals.
- ***Function closures***: functions can be _closures_, and in this case they will embed all the external variables present at the time of their declaration together with its code.
- ***Prototype-based object orientation***: unlike other class-based object programming language, _JavaScript_ uses prototypes, and this has to be taken into consideration when objects are defined.
